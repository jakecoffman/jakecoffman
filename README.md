Favorite board and card games ♠️ ♥️ ♣️ ♦️:
- Puerto Rico - low randomness
- Small World - low randomness
- Settlers of Catan - good for new board gamers
- Oh Hell - good for groups of many sizes and very easy to pick up (3-7 people)
- Euchre - good with a partner, not as big of a commitment as hearts/spades

Favorite video games for kids 🎮:
- Stardew Valley
  - Learn about how food is grown, how seasons work, no death or losing
- Outer Wilds
  - Learn about solar systems, why night and day exist, orbital physics 😆
- Wilmot's Warehouse
  - Cooperative game of organization, no outright losing until the end
